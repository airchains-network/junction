- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling and verification of transaction batches
- **IBC Integration**: Native support for Inter-Blockchain Communication
- **Prover Integration**: Flexible integration with various proving systems
- **Economic Model**: Built-in staking mechanism for rollup security

### **Improved Query & Transaction Processing**

- Optimized verification key management
- Enhanced query functionalities for seamless blockchain interactions
- Robust batch handling for large-scale transaction processing
- Advanced rollup state management and coordination

## ðŸ“¥ Installation & Setup

### Download the Binary

Ensure you download the appropriate binary for your operating system:

- **Visit the [release page](https://github.com/airchains-network/junction/releases/tag/v0.3.2)** and select the correct binary:

  - **Linux**: `junctiond-linux-amd64`

- Rename the downloaded file for convenience:

  ```shell
  mv <downloaded-binary> junctiond
  ```

- Make it executable:

  ```shell
  chmod +x junctiond
  ```

- Move it to your system's binary path:

  ```shell
  sudo mv junctiond /usr/local/bin
  ```

### Initialize the Network

To set up **Junction**, run the following command:

```shell
junctiond init <moniker> --chain-id varanasi-1 --default-denom uamf
```

This initializes a node with your chosen moniker and configures it for the **Junction** network.

### Start the Junction Node

Launch your node with:

```shell
junctiond start
```

Your node is now active and participating in the **Junction** settlement layer!
